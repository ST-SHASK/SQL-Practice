SQL架构
Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+



Answer:
用2个变量统计。pre变量统计上一次Num，cnt统计连续次数
SELECT DISTINCT a.Num ConsecutiveNums 
FROM 
(
    SELECT t.Num, @cnt:=IF(@pre=t.Num, @cnt+1, 1) cnt, @pre:=t.Num pre
    FROM Logs t, (SELECT @pre:=null, @cnt:=0) b
) a
WHERE a.cnt >= 3
