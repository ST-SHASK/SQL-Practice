Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, 
keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Note:

Your output is the whole Person table after executing your sql. Use delete statement.


Answer:
DELETE FROM Person
WHERE Id NOT IN (   -- 删除不在查询结果中的值
    SELECT id FROM
   (
       SELECT MIN(Id) AS Id -- 排除Email相同时中Id较大的行
       FROM Person
       GROUP BY Email
   ) AS temp    -- 此处需使用临时表，否则会发生报错
)
