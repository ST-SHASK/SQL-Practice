Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. 
If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

Answer:
1.Limit + distinct
select (
select distinct Salary
from Employee
order by Salary desc
limit 1,1
) as SecondHighestSalary;

2.max
select 
max(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from Employee
where 
Salary < (select max(Salary) from Employee);
